# UFOs
### Overview of UFO Sightings Project:
In this project, we were asked to build a table from the provided javascript array. We were also asked to build a dynamic webpage using HTML that would respond to input and provide information to users about UFOs. We used Bootstraps components to elevate the appearance of the website and provided a cleaner more sophisticated interface. The information provided on the website will allow users to navigate and parse through UFO data using filters.

## Resources: 
Javascript<br/>
HTML<br/>
CSS<br/>
Bootstraps<br/>

## Results: 
When the user scrolls down they will see all the data presented on a table. On the left-hand side, they will see a series of filters to narrow down their search. From this image below we have 5 different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country & shape. The user may choose any of these filters, and press enter, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings that match the criteria they set. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data.

## Summary:

#### Drawback of the Webpage
Having the filters open to any character input can lead to user errors. It would be more user-friendly if a dropdown list was used for all 5 of these filters, this way the user can know right away if there is any data for Alaska without a filter because it would not appear in the dropdown options.

#### Recommendation To Improve the Webpage
Adding a filter for comments
Data could be cleaned; city, state, and country data are all in lower case which makes it confusing for the user. The data should be cleaned to improve searchability. The city data would have the first letter capitalized and state and countries would be completely capitalized.
