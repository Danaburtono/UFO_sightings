# UFOs
Overview of Project:
In this project we were asked to build a Javascript table from the provided array. We were also asked to build a dynamic webpage using HTML that would respond input. We used Bootstraps imports to elivate the websites appearance and provided a cleaner more sophisticated interface. The information provided on the website will allow users to navigate and parse through UFO data using filters. 

Resources: 
Javascript
HTML 
CSS
Bootstraps

Results: 
When the user scrolls down they will see all the data presented on a table. On the lefthand side they will see a series of filters to narrow down their search. From this image below we have 5 different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country & shape. The user may choose any of these filters, press enter, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings that match the criteria they set. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data.

Summary:

Drawback of the Webpage
Having the filters open to any character input can lead to user errors. It would be more user friendly if a dropdown list was used for all 5 of these filters, this way the user can know right away if there is any data for Alaska without filter because it would not appear in the downdown options.

Recommendation To Improve the Webpage
Adding a filter for comments
Data could be cleaned, the city, state, and country data are all in lower case which makes it confusing for the user. The data should be cleaned to improve searchablity. City would have the first letter capitalized and state and countries would be compeletely capitalized.
